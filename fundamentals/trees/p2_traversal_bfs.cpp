/*
A Tree Data Structure can be traversed in following ways:

* Depth First Search or DFS
    * Inorder Traversal (left, root, right) - for BST, it prints elemenst in increasing order
    * Preorder Traversal (root, left, right) - used to get prefix expressions
    * Postorder Traversal (left, right, root) - used for deletion of tree
* Level Order Traversal or Breadth First Search or BFS - can be implemented in two approaches (Queue or brute force)
* Boundary Traversal
* Diagonal Traversal

This program is for BFS - Will revisit later
